\section{Introduction}
HCI or Human Computer Interaction, is the most important part in allowing humans to feel connected to whatever machine they are using. Good HCI can make a user feel immersed in using technology as if it was apart of them, an extension of themselves, bad HCI can make a user feel nauseated, angry or irritated, the way technology and computers are used nowadays is very important in making the user feel satisfied with what they are using.
\\
It is all about being as user-friendly as possible.
\\
\\
Researching the ways people use and feel about technology is important in order to improve on technology an create a better HCI for the users.

\section{Research Journal Focus}
This Research Journal will focus on the way certain research methods are used in researching human computer interaction with video games and other related software.
